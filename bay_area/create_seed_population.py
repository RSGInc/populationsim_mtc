Create seed files for MTC Bay Area populationsim from PUMS 2017-2021.

Columns used:
- PUMA (housing and person), to filter to bay area for housing and person records
- ESR (person), Employment Status Recode, to count workers per housing record
- SERIALNO (hh and person), to group persons to housing record, to count workers per housing record
- ADJINC and HINCP (hh), used to adjust household income to 2010 dollars
- NP (housing), to filter out vacant unitsf
- TYPEHUGQ (housing), to filter to households and non-institutional group quarters
- MIL (person), to inform gqtype for group quarters persons
- SCHG (person), to inform gqtype for group quarters persons

New columns in housing records file:
- hh_workers_from_esr: count of employed persons in household
- hh_income_2021     : household income in 2010 dollars, based on HINCP and ADJINC
- unique_hh_id       : integer unique id for housing unit, starting with 1
- hhgqtype           : 0 for non gq, 1 is college student, 2 is military, 3 is other
- PWGT               : for group quarters file only, transfered from person records
New columns in person records file:
- employed           : 0 or 1, based on ESR
- soc                : 2 digit code, based on first two characters of SOCP
- occupation         : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, based on soc
- WGTP               : from housing record
- unique_hh_id       : from housing record
- gqtype             : f0 is not group quarters, 1 is college student, 2 is military, 3 is other
